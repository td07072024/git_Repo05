Syama Prasad Mookerjee (6 July 1901 – 23 June 1953) was an Indian politician and academician. Noted for his opposition to Quit India movement within the independence movement in India, he later served as India's first Minister for Industry and Supply (currently known as Minister of Commerce and Industries) in Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's cabinet after breaking up with the Hindu Mahasabha. After falling out with Nehru,[3] protesting against the Liaquat–Nehru Pact, Mukherjee resigned from Nehru's cabinet.[4] With the help of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh,[5] he founded the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the predecessor to the Bharatiya Janata Party, in 1951.[6]
